# BootCamp Online 79 Practice

## Course description

This course is designed as a dynamic, hands-on journey through the world of
JavaScript. Unlike traditional theoretical lectures, each session is built
around a series of progressive practical challenges that mirror real-world
development scenarios. Students actively practice the mechanics of working with
scripts and master the syntactic constructions of the JS language by solving
tasks step-by-step. This "learning by doing" approach ensures that every concept
is immediately reinforced through practice, allowing students to bridge the gap
between abstract code and functional applications.

By the end of this course, students will have developed a robust technical
foundation and a professional problem-solving mindset. They will gain the
practical skills and confidence needed to build interactive web projects and
successfully transition to advanced software development frameworks.
